This project showcases an advanced IoT-based home automation system that leverages WiFi technology to connect various components. The system is scalable and can manage and monitor home appliances and security devices through an intuitive Android app. It incorporates an ESP12E WiFi module, Arduino Nano, and nRF24L01 transceiver modules. Key functionalities include remote control of lights, fans, and other devices, real-time temperature monitoring, gas leak detection, and motion sensing. The system is capable of sending alerts for gas leaks or fire hazards and can automatically turn off gas valves or open windows. Additionally, it logs appliance usage to assist in power management. This project highlights skills in hardware and software integration and practical applications for improving home security and energy efficiency.
